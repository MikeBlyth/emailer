<p>It has been three years since our last newsletter. While the “code”
of our daily lives hasn’t changed much, the version updates have been
significant.</p>
<h1 id="the-gift-of-aha-moments">The Gift of “Aha” Moments</h1>
<p>After a couple of years of working part-time at a great pediatric
practice, I officially retired a year ago. I’ve spent much of my time
since as a volunteer math, statistics, and computer science tutor with
<a href="https://www.upchieve.org">Upchieve</a> (<a
href="https://www.upchieve.org">https://www.upchieve.org</a>). This
program is a great approach to educational inequality: it provides free,
24/7 online tutoring to low-income middle and high school students.</p>
<p>The highlight for me isn’t just the teaching; it’s that specific
moment when a student who has been struggling or feeling far behind
suddenly tells me they finally “get it.” Watching a student’s confidence
shift after they ace an assignment they thought was impossible is so
rewarding. Upchieve is always looking for volunteers, and the schedule
is totally open—you just log on when you have a spare 30 minutes. If you
are looking for a high-impact way to use some spare time, I’d love to
talk to you about it. Check it out at the link above.</p>
<h1 id="adaptability-and-resilience">Adaptability and Resilience</h1>
<p>Barb is finding new ways to stay involved at church, contributing to
her Bible study and helping prepare meals for a local homeless center.
As for activities, while her vision loss has made reading impossible and
writing and cooking more difficult, she is finding ways to cope such as
reading lots of audio books. We’ve found a modern workaround for our
evening entertainment: Barb uses a Quest VR headset instead of a TV. The
lenses help her see films with much more clarity, and we’ve spent many
good evenings enjoying shows like <em>The Good Karma Hospital</em> and
<em>Miss Scarlet</em>.</p>
<h1 id="milestones-from-tuscany-to-california">Milestones: From Tuscany
to California</h1>
<p>Last year marked our 50th anniversary. We used it as the perfect
excuse for a two-week trip to Italy in April, soaking in the scenery,
history and art of Tuscany, Rome, and Milan. In contrast, a more somber
milestone was a trip to California this month for a memorial service for
Barb’s brother Bob. While it was a sad occasion, being surrounded by
family in California provided a meaningful opportunity to reconnect and
remember why these relationships are so vital.</p>
<h1 id="family-close-to-home">Family Close to Home: </h1>
<p>We’ve been blessed to have Lisa’s and Saralynn’s families living in
the same apartment complex as us for the past two years.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lisa:</strong> We’ve been so impressed watching Lisa
balance the rigors of full-time nursing school with parenting. She
doesn’t just cope with the workload, but genuinely loves the academics
and clinical experience.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Saralynn</strong> continues to thrive as an administrator
at Georgetown, where her wizardry with Excel and logistics keeps the
French department running smoothly. We love having her so close by,
where we get to see her latest crocheted blankets and hear updates on
her favorite audiobooks and all things <em>Star Trek</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The “Littles,”</strong> Miriam (9) and Selah (7), are a
constant source of fun. Selah recently wrote a note to the family cat:
<em>“Cats rock. You are a cat. You rock. If you dont no what you rock,
it mien I rely like you.”</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Next Generation:</strong> Our most recent graduate,
Siah, is living with us while he trains to become a firefighter—having
him here is a real bonus for us. Meanwhile, Naomi is wrapping up her
degree in film, Ethan is headed to the University of Alabama on a full
National Merit scholarship, and Timothy is aiming for UCLA or Howard
University.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Further afield, Jonathan and Kelly, married last year, are enjoying
life with our newest grandchild, Willow, in Milwaukee. In Bakersfield,
Luke remains our resident history buff. While walking is becoming harder
and more painful for him despite physical therapy, he is still able to
visit us for several weeks each December.</p>
<h1 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h1>
<p>Like many of you, we have become more than just “politically
engaged;” we view the current state of our nation as the crisis of our
lifetime. We have been aghast to watch the decline of a stable,
law-based democracy and the rise of authoritarianism and the
demonization of others. Having lived in authoritarian and failing
countries, we recognize these patterns with a visceral clarity and have
no desire to see them repeated here. With Lisa as our star encourager,
we have channeled this alarm into action—participating in protests,
voter mobilization, and advocacy. We urge you to join us in this
critical work.</p>
<p>We’ll leave you with a few recommendations that moved us this
year:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Books:</strong> <em>Everything Sad is Untrue</em> by
Daniel Nyeri (a beautiful storytelling memoir) and both <em>The Covenant
of Water</em> and <em>Cutting for Stone</em> by Abraham Verghese. For a
historical perspective on our current climate, we recommend <em>Jesus
and John Wayne</em> by Kristin Kobes Du Mez. For fun with a serious
twist, the Don Tillman series (starting with <em>The Rosie Project)</em>
by Graeme C. Simsion kept us laughing on long road trips.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Screen:</strong> <em>The Visitor</em> (2007) and <em>The
Samuel Project</em> (2018) were two of many standout films for us this
year.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Wishing you a year of progress, blessing, “aha” moments, and cats
that rock.</p>
